SICP
====

Exercises from "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs"

Setup
=====
For this project I'm using Racket and it's environment DrRacket. I'm working on Ubuntu 12.04.

    $ sudo apt-get install libjpeg62 # An issue with the next command required this.
    $ sudo apt-get install racket
    
I can now run DrRacket.

    $ drracket
  
I then needed DrRacket to evaluate SICP lisp.

1. In the bottom left corner click “Determine Language from Source“.
2. Select “Choose Language”.
3. Select "Use the language declared in the source“.
4. Click "Run".
